Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. 
You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.
Task: Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.
Solution: const myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."
