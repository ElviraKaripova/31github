If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator,
everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned.
This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have defined a function sum which adds two numbers together.

Task: Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed. 
Given: // Setup
let processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
} 

Solution: processed = processArg(7);
